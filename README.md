# restitution-momentum-calc

A Python3 project I made as a proof of concept for collisions based on newtons law of restitution for my CAIE A Level Further Maths 9231 Mechanics course.
This project uses the math library and matrices from the numpy library in order to make simultaneous equations using conservation of momentum and Newtons law of restitution to calculate speeds of objects after colliding given a coefficient of restitution x, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
It greatly helped me understand the topic better and also helped me verify my answers for my calculations.

It **requires** numpy to be installed, which can be done with
>pip3 install numpy

in an app such as terminal, cmd, or powershell. 
^skip this step if it is already installed.
